We live in a connected world:  more and more people share various moments of their daily lifeon social networks, mostly by posting photos, videos and descriptions. Consequently, every day billions of geo-referenced data are generated by user activities shaping what are generally known as digital footprints and providing inspiring insights about human activities and behaviors.

This  research  aims  at  studying  the  geographical  contour  of  Turin  in  order  to  provide  the administration a tool for capturing the users’ perception about the city.  Through the analysis ofthe geo-tagged contents published on Flickr and Instagram, a pipeline comprehending clustering and classification techniques will provide a powerful link between the technology latent data andthe municipalities’ need for feedback and guidance to past and new investments.

The  results  show  that  both  global  studies  about  the  city  and  specific  investigations  on particular zones and periods are feasible and reliable on respect to both our knowledge of the city and real indexes such as the cadastral value.
