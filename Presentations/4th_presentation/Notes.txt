As mentioned during the previous presentations, at this point the goal is finding out the city zones using a density-based clustering on the points' coordinates.

The points passes through a run of the DB-Scan method in order to identify outliers and secondary clusters; this is done in order to lately run the K-Means with a lower inertia, since the litterature affirms that a higher one  might lead the algorithm to perform less efficiently.
Both the parameters of DBScan and K-Means are tuned with the Silhouettes method, which is an index that works with inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances and gets closer to 1 if the clusters are well separated. [CAMBIA]

As Vincenzo was previously explayining, the studied algorithm is very elastic and allows us a deeper analysis on different years (i.e: the situation of Vanchiglia over the years) [CAMBIA], a zoomed outlook on some of the found clusters (i.e. the center of Turin and its very recognizible zones) [CAMBIA] and finally even weekdays and weekends. 
Regarding the latter, it's peculiar how as far as the number of points gets lower the algorithm tends to find with more precision the main 'points of attraction' of each cluster. [CAMBIA]

As it could be noticed, the tool is very powerful and, working with no priors (no previous knoledges / parameters/ settings) on the city under study, could be possibly extended to other cities or periods.
While exploring these capabilities anyway, we realized that with a limited dataset very punctual analysis (like the Derby day, which is expected to produce peculiar geometries on the city) are not feasible and does not produce appreciable results. This might be a weakness of the approach and should lead further researches to enlarge the available data in order to get more descriptive power.

Now I leave the floor to Arianna which will tell us about the supervised part of the research.
